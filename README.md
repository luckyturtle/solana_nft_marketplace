## Storefronts Royalties

All identification on the Storefront is based on wallet addresses. Creators and store admins sign through their wallets, and users place mints from connected wallets.

Each NFT can also be minted with configurable royalty payments that are then sent automatically to the contributors whenever an artwork is minted by someone.

The design and layout of storefronts were customized to suit the needs of a permanent storefront for a specific collection.
